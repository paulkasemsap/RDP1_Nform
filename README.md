## Workflow
The following diagram illustrates two major workflows employed in "Genome-Wide Association Study of Rice (*Oryza sativa* L.) Early Biomass Production under Different Inorganic Nitrogen Forms — Ammonium or Nitrate": 1) **Biomass workflow** ```analysis.r``` and 2) **Post-GWAS workflow** ```selectSNP.r```. The two work workflows are connected by the Genome-Wide Association Study (**GWAS**) ```GAPIT.r```. Text box colors and styles denote file types in the analysis workflow as followed: White box with solid lines (data), white box with dashed blue lines (intermediate result), blue box (main result included in the manuscript), green box (supplementary material).
